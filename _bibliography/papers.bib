abstract = {{In the realm of multiferroicity in 2D magnets, whether magnetic and polar skyrmions can coexist within a single topological entity has emerged as an important question. Here, we study Janus 2D magnets CrInX3 (X=Se, Te) for a comprehensive investigation of the magnetic ground state, magnetic excited state, and corresponding ferroelectric polarization by first-principles electronic structure calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, we have thoroughly elucidated the magnetic exchange mechanisms, and have fully exemplified the magnetic field dependence of the magnon spectrum. More importantly, our study reveals a previously unrecognized, remarkably large spin-spiral-induced ferroelectric polarization (up to 194.9 μC/m2) in both compounds. We propose an approach to identify polar skyrmions within magnetic skyrmions, based on the observed direct correlation between spin texture and polarization density. Elucidating this correlation not only deepens our understanding of magnetic skyrmions but also paves the way for innovative research in the realm of multiferroic skyrmions.}},

Structural analysis uncovers that the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition is intricately linked to the Fe/Ti displacement of square-planar Fe/TiO4. Notably, the magnetic LaFeMnNiO6 and LaTiMnNiO6 compounds demonstrate robust ferroelectric polarizations, measuring 20.0 and 21.8µC/cm2, respectively, accompanied by minimalist forbidden energy gaps of 1.40 and 1.18 eV using the generalized gradient approximation +U method. Furthermore, we pinpoint elevated magnetic transition temperatures for these compounds. Additionally, our study scrutinizes the energies associated with diverse spin configurations and identifies potential minimum decomposition pathways into stable oxides. This comprehensive analysis ensures the meticulous formation of the LaFeMnNiO6 and LaTiMnNiO6 compounds.}},

Specifically, CrO features two pairs of spin-polarized anisotropic Weyl points at the Fermi level. By manipulating the position of these Weyl points with strain, we demonstrate that four different antiferromagnetic spintronic states with zero net magnetic moments can be achieved, including semimetals with two spin-polarized transport channels, half-semimetals, semiconductors with two spin-polarized transport channels, and half-semiconductors. The strain-induced semiconducting state also preserves the ultra-high carrier mobility of Weyl points, and the bandgap can be easily tuned. These findings offer a good avenue in spintronics without net magnetic moment or strong spin–orbit coupling and could lead to the development of antiferromagnetic materials for spintronic applications.}},

The observation of the antiferromagnetism in RETiO3 (RE=rare-earth) series has been puzzling since the celebrated Kugel-Khomskii model of spin-orbital superexchange predicts ferromagnetism in an orbitally degenerate d1 system. Further, the existence of the orbitally ordered vs. orbital liquid phase in both antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phase have been unsettled issues thus far. To address these longstanding questions, we investigate single crystalline film of PrTiO3. Our synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements confirm the retention of bulklike orthorhombic (D2h) symmetry in the thin film geometry. We observe similar x-ray linear dichroism signal in both paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phase, which can be accounted by ferro-orbital ordering (FOO). While the presence of D2h crystal field does not guarantee lifting of orbital degeneracy always, we find it to be strong enough in these rare-earth titanates, leading to the FOO state. Thus, our work demonstrates the orthorhombic distortion is the driving force for the orbital ordering of antiferromagnetic RETiO3.}},

Here, using density functional theory calculations, we elucidate that the stabilization of the (√3 × √3)R30° supercell structure is caused by the swapping of Fe atoms occurring in the monolayer limit. The swapping to the vicinity of Te atoms is facilitated by the spontaneous occurrence of Fe vacancy and its low diffusion barrier. Our calculated magnetic exchange parameters show the simultaneous presence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange among a particular type of Fe atom. The Fe sublattice projected magnetization obtained from Monte Carlo simulations clearly demonstrates an exotic temperature-dependent behavior of this Fe type along with a large canting angle at T = 0 K, indicating the presence of a complex noncollinear magnetic order. We propose that the low-temperature crystal structure results from the swapping between two sublattices of Fe, giving rise to peculiar magnetization obtained in experiments.}},

Our ab initio study based on collinear density functional theory has revealed the ground state as an antiferromagnetic one with an ordering temperature of around 100 K along with a signature of spin-phonon coupling, which may trigger a ferromagnetic coupling via strain. Moreover, our calculations based on spin spirals indicate the possibility of noncollinear magnetic structures, which is also supported by Monte Carlo simulations based on ab initio magnetic exchange parameters. This opens up an excellent possibility to manipulate magnetic structures by the application of directional strain.}},

An interesting example is CrI3, where the interlayer magnetic coupling can be determined by the stacking sequence. Here we present a systematic study of the magnetic properties of monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer CrI3 by using density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The effects of different stacking sequences and the number of layers on the magnetic interaction in multilayer CrI3 have been critically analyzed. We have found that the antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling occurs with specific interlayer shifting, while intralayer exchange interactions increase with the number of layers. It is noteworthy that interlayer interactions are independent of the number of layers, whereas the magnetic ordering temperature rises with the increasing number of layers. Moreover, we present the Curie temperatures obtained from Monte Carlo simulations and adiabatic magnon spectra for all the stacking sequences considered here.}},

abstract = {{A- and B-site ordered quadruple perovskites with the chemical formula AA3′B2B2′O12 can form with 1:3 ratio at the A site. A unique feature of this specially ordered perovskite is that three different atomic sites (A′, B, and B′ sites) can all accommodate magnetic transition metals. As a consequence, multiple magnetic and electronic interactions can occur at A′, B, and/or B′ sites, giving rise to a series of intriguing physical phenomena. CaCu3Fe2Re2O12 is a good example, which shows half-metallic electronic structure, large magnetization, and a very high Curie temperature. Here we investigated a series of ferrimagnetic (FiM) compounds ACu3Fe2Re2O12 (A=Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb, Sc, Y, La) by using density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. We found that all compounds with A2+ ions exhibit high Curie temperatures (above 405 K), and the compounds with A3+ substitution yield even higher TC (above 502 K). By examining interatomic exchange parameters, we found that the antiferromagnetic exchange couplings between Re and Cu as well as Re and Fe are responsible for this very high Curie temperature. For the compounds with A3+ substitution, electron doping in bands around the Fermi level dominated by the Re ions strengthens the Re-Cu, Re-Fe, and Re-Re exchange interactions, which cause an increase in the critical temperature. Finally, we calculated the formation energies of the quadruple perovskites with respect to the possible decomposition pathways and have found that the values are reasonable for the synthesis of these compounds under the conditions of high pressure and high temperature. In summary, this work demonstrates a design strategy of enhancing the spin ordering temperature by replacing A-site nonmagnetic ions.}},

All the doped samples Pb(Fe1 − xYbx)2/3W1/3O3 (PFYWO) (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) were found to crystallize in an ordered cubic ( F m 3 ¯ m ) structure with partial ordering in the B-perovskite sites. Observed changes in the cationic order were accompanied by differences in the dielectric and magnetic responses of the system. While pure PbFe2/3W1/3O3 is antiferromagnetic, the doped Pb(Fe1 − xYbx)2/3W1/3O3 PFYWO samples display excess moments and ferrimagnetic-like behavior, associated with differences in B′ and B″ site occupancies of the magnetic Fe3+ cations. The magnetic transition temperature of the ferrimagnetic phase is found to decrease with increasing Yb content, from TN ∼350 K of the undoped sample down to 137 K for x = 0.5. All PFYWO compounds display a ferroelectric relaxor behavior akin to that of PbFe2/3W1/3O3, albeit our results show significant changes of the frequency and temperature dependence of the dielectric properties. The changes of the properties of PFYWO with increasing Yb substitution can be explained by the changes in the cation size/charge mismatch and the size difference of the two ordered positions.}},

Different orderings of B (B') cationic sites in A2BB'O6 double perovskite structure are evaluated, including rocksalt, columnar and layered arrangements for cubic, monoclinic and tetragonal crystal structures.

The resulting carbon-encapsulated NiCu (denoted as NiCu@C) composite possesses a well-defined core–shell structure with tunable thicknesses of the shells and is examined as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic, neutral, and alkaline solutions. Electrochemical measurements indicate that the activity of the NiCu@C highly depends on the thickness of the shell. Single-layered graphene encapsulated NiCu nanoparticles show remarkable HER activity and durability. To obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2, overpotentials of 48, 164, and 74 mV are needed in electrolyte solutions with pH = 0, 7, and 14, respectively. Such low overpotentials render the composite as one of the most active nonprecious electrocatalysts. Accelerated durability tests demonstrate that the NiCu@C catalysts exhibit excellent stability. Density function theory calculations are conducted to investigate the electronic structures of the NiCu@C.
